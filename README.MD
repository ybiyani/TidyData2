Project 
====================
Title: "ReadMe for TidyData Project"
------------------

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

The output was to create a R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:

1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.

4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


## Data

The data for the project was collected from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip and unzipped in a folder called Project 


```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```
